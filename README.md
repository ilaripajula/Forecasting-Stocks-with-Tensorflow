# Forecasting-Stocks-with-Tensorflow
Program that performs time series forecasting of publicly listed stock prices with a convolutional neural network. Pulls historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. Adapted from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series. 

To run, adjust the variables to your liking in data_train.py and run in an IDE.

NOTES:
A good selection of features is something I am working on. I have found that using a variety, but not too many, technical indicators with TAlib works well.
