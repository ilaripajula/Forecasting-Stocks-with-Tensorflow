# Forecasting-Stocks-with-Tensorflow
Program that performs time series forecasting of publicly listed stock prices with a convolutional neural network. Pulls historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. Adapted from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series. 

To run, adjust the variables to your liking in data_train.py and run in an IDE.

NOTES:
For better results than in the example, consider adding more features to the training data. Some suggestions are index price data (S&P500,...) or techincal indicators (MACD, RSI), or price data of competitors stocks.
